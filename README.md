<h4> About
<p>This is my third project submission for Android Developer Nanodegree Program (Udacity).

<h4> TODO
<p>Before running the app append your API Key in the NetworkUtils.java, in the String: API_KEY (indicated by a TODO).  
<p>The string should look like private static final String API_KEY = "api_key=112233445566778899", where 112233445566778899 is your API Key.
